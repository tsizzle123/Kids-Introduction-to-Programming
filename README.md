Python is also an option, but using a strongly typed langauage such the prior listed is recommended. We will be using Javascript (JS), Java, and Scratch for this #guide. We will start with scratch to esbalish the fundamentals of programming, then move onto more advanced OOP topics via Minecraft Java. After this, a verbose guide will be added.
