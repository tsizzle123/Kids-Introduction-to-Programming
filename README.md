Kids Introduction to Programming Overview 

This is an outline for a first time introduction to programming. This file will feed into a m

First thing is to get a core understanding of the underlying mathematics. 

It is key to understand Object Orientation at the begininng of programming. Some easy languages to practice this with are: Java, C#, C++, Javascript. Python is also an option, but using a strongly typed langauage such the prior listed is recommended. We will be using Javascript (JS), Java, and Scratch for this #guide. We will start with scratch to esbalish the fundamentals of programming, then move onto more advanced OOP topics via Minecraft Java. After this, a verbose guide will be added.
